# Home Assistant Add-on: Ring Recorder

Exposes an HTTP server to request and store video recording snapshots using ring video cameras. The recording transcodes the camera's livestream to a video file of the requested length. This add-on could not function without the excellent work from Dusty Greif's [node.js ring library](https://github.com/dgreif/ring).
